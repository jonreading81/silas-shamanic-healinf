# My Story

There are many challenges that we face during our lives some can be traumatic and can stay with us as pain, mark us for life, obscuring our own truth and dictate how we act and perceive our way through life. Trauma can also be ongoing, “low key” perhaps, that also puts us in a place of loss and can be a drain to our very own soul. These are good times to see a healer.

This is a short story of my journey to where I am now.

Through tremendous pain and suffering that I endured in my younger days as a child and after living a life of anger, regret and unhappiness and most of all putting others through my misery, I contacted Laura Eisenhower an astrologer and Psychic. I had a reading with her that put things into place. She told my life story through the planets and directed me to learn the ways of the ancient. I had done a fair bit by then and had seen other healers which were also very enthusiasticabout this development that was happening in my life. One woman by the name of Margret directed me to the college of Psychic studies. I had had arranged to go somewhere else to start this work but then had to make a decision to change locations as the college of Psychic studies was better for my development. I had no idea what I was getting myself into and where this was all heading. But I knew it was good.

At the College Of Psychic Studies I met a man called Gary. This particular meeting was out of the ordinary and very synchronize. Gary is a Psychic and medium and holds classes for people that are interested in this type of work. He took me through two years of teaching. The man could see everything about me, most of it I didn’t even know at the time. The one thing he kept saying was shamanic, ether in a joking manner or being quite serious. I still didn’t get it. But over the years I started to see what he was talking about through the readings I was giving during class and also then reflecting back on my life’s journey so far. I was finally intrigued enough to asked him where I can train to learn the shamanic ways because I could feel the push to healing myself was in this direction, or at least the start. I enrolled on a course in the uk with a British shaman by the name of Jez Hughes. The training here has been three years and is still ongoing.

Over the years we’d meet in a woodlands near Horsham. This training brought up a lot of challenges during the years, it was at times very gruelling but it also taught me self love I became clearer and had a better sense of myself and what I want to do. I’ve always had an
interest in human nature. The Love for humanity has always been deeply seated within me and I was uncovering it more and more. The empathy that I have for humanity and our human condition and all our triumphs and what we think are our faults feel so dear to me. This does now feels like the time to express this.

During the shamanic training I decided to continue with Reiki healing. I had had an Angelic reiki healing from a friend and could not get over how much it had made a difference. I decided to enrol on a workshop to be attuned to the angelic realm, which was more than satisfying. I have now completed the master teacher level and practice Angelic Reiki on a regular basis. The healings that I’ve witnessed with Angelic Rieki have been phenomenal. The amount of love and understanding that I’ve felt from the other side to the unique and untainted messages that have come through that have been personal and of healing for the client have been extraordinary. I do feel very excited to share this with others.

The practice of shamanism is very physical for me, from ceremony and ritual to giving offerings in prayer. It’s something I can touch and be part of and relate too In my own way. It’s deepened my relationship with the earth the plant and animal kingdom, with humanity and then myself and my connection to all. It’s brought me out of my shell and into transformation forever it seems. It’s cleared an opening through the pain and suffering and given me more of a sense of myself and what’s needed in this life. Shamanism is about service to the land and the elements through ceremony and ritual, being in community with others and of service to others. This is where the magic happens and the healing of yourself can then accrue. Just by giving a simple offering to the land and spirit and then listening to what is needed is one of the simplest ways into this world. This is what I’ve been learning over the years and that it’s not all about healing myself but that that is an off shoot and a bioproduct of the shamanic work. The more healing's I do the more I sit in ceremony and in community the more I learn and the closer I come to seeing this intricate and phenomenal life that we all have a part in.

I did a sit out ceremony in some woodland near to wear I stay in london. This involved fasting on the day and then sitting in an area next to a tree right the way through till the next morning awake. I’m very fond of the squirrels that live in this area and because I go to this area frequently it seems they know me too. The sun had set and darkness was approaching. One of the squirrels ran along a branch in front of me, it stopped and looked at me. I said out aloud “can you please eat for me” it walked along the branch and stopped and dug out a nut of some sort and sat there eating it. I felt nourished in an instant and thanked the squirrel for helping me.

What is our relationship with the plant kingdom what is our relationship with the animal kingdom what is our relationship with the earth, this is the very thing that is breaking us as a civilisation as a community and as one , that’s causing sickness amongst our selves and an imbalance between the land and us as a human species. Shamanism is one of the ways into this a connection to spirit a connection to life and all that lies behind in the mystery and unseen worlds.
